This is a node implementation of a reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator. A simple console interface was implemented to provide basic inputs to and render outputs from the RPN module.  With more effort, I might extend the implementation to support several variations on how Infinity, NaN, Epsilon, and any other possible special representations of the Number type in Node.js might be entered as input (i.e. entering INF instead of Infinity).

To run the code, you will need to install the npm dependencies and execute the application via

`npm install`
`npm start`

To run the unit tests, simply execute

`npm test`
